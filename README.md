## Overview 

The purpose of the analysis was to create visualisations in Tableau for stakeholders to present them the idea of bike-sharing service.
The dataset was downloaded from [https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data). After changing the data type of one of the columns, the dataset was used to create a number of visualisations to demonstrate trip duration trends and the relations between users' demographics and popular riding times.


## Results

The following visualisations were created :

## Summary

Based on the analysis we can see that the bike-sharing service is mostly used by work commuters rather than tourists, because peak usage hours are around 8am and from 4pm to 7pm. The average trip duration is 5 minutes which means that users prefer short-distanced trips. This information can be used for future planning of bike-sharing stations. It would be convenient to locate them not more then 10 minutes far from each other for convenience. Also, the majority of the users are males. This can be used for future marketing campaigns.

For additional visualisations, we could show the number of most popular end stations to show that these stations could be used for placing service shops nerby. Also, we could visualize the longest trip durations to show how many bikes we in long-term use. This could help in planning the subscription offers for users.
